# **Backtrace Source maps tools**

[Backtrace](https://backtrace.io) captures and reports handled and unhandled exceptions in your production software so you can manage application quality through the complete product lifecycle.

The [@backtrace-labs/sourcemap-tools](#) SDK connects all source maps tools created by Backtrace on all platforms. In this package you can find the common code shared by all our modules. For platform-specific implementation or overrides, please visit our repository https://github.com/backtrace-labs/backtrace-javascript
